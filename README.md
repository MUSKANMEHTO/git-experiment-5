# Git Experiment 5

## 🎯 Objective
To collaborate using GitHub and manage multiple branches effectively.

---

## 🛠️ Software/Tools Used
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Code editor with Git integration  
- **Git** – Distributed version control system  
- **GitHub** – Cloud-based hosting for Git repositories  

---

## 📖 Theory
- **Git** is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code and allows multiple developers to collaborate.  
- **GitHub** is a cloud platform built on Git that provides remote repositories, collaboration features, and project management tools.  
- **Visual Studio Code** integrates with Git and GitHub, enabling developers to manage repositories, commits, and branches directly from the editor.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Remote Repository
A remote repository is stored on GitHub. It allows:
- Backup of code in the cloud  
- Collaboration with teammates  
- Synchronization across devices  

### 2. Branch Management
A branch is a separate line of development:
- **Main branch (`main`)** → Production-ready code  
- **Feature branches** → Used for developing features or bug fixes independently

## 📝 Procedure

### 1. Setup Remote Repository
- A new repository `git-experiment-5` was created on GitHub.  
- The local repo was connected with:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/MUSKANMEHTO/git-experiment-5.git
